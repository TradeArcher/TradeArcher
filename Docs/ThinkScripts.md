5. Change the name of the script from the default **"NewStudy0"** to something you can remember.  I suggest the name of the script if you are copying from the scripts provided here.  
6. Press the green **"OK"** button for the script and the **"Edit Studies and Strategies"** windows.  

Now the script should be applied to your chart.  

NOTE: This same process applies to adding **Strategies** except you need to make sure you select the **"Strategies"** tab on the **"Edit Studies and Strategies"** window.
