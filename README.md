This is the project for development of the UWP (Windows Store) TradeArcher2020 application written in C#/Xaml.

TradeArcher2020 lets you import your trade history and back test results for multiple Brokerage Accounts and provides tools to analyze your trades, develop and refine strategies and document your trade plans.  It keeps all of your information on your local machine.  No need to worry about your data being mined by others.  With TradeArcher2020, your data is yours and it stays on your own device.  

If you use ThinkOrSwim Strategies to back test trading ideas, you can use TradeArcher2020 to import the results of multiple back test exports from ToS to analyze the results.
